"The Rise of Edge Computing"

Edge computing is transforming how modern applications process and deliver data.
Traditionally, most computation happened in centralized cloud servers, but this
approach introduces latency and bandwidth limitations.

With edge computing, data is processed closer to the source—whether it is a
sensor, mobile device, autonomous vehicle, or IoT system. This allows faster
responses, reduced channel congestion, and improved reliability.

Industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation rely on edge
architectures to support real-time decision making. For example, autonomous cars
cannot afford delays in communication with distant cloud servers. Instead, they
use edge processing units to interpret sensor data instantly.

Although edge computing cannot entirely replace cloud platforms, the combination
of both creates a hybrid model. This hybrid edge-cloud strategy is becoming the
foundation of next-generation distributed systems.
