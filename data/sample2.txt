"DSA"

Data structures are essential for solving problems efficiently.
Common structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and hashmaps.

Algorithms like binary search, sorting, and recursion help optimize performance.
Understanding time complexity is a key aspect of writing scalable programs.

Practice and consistency are important for mastering DSA.
